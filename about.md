My name is Jorge Rocha. I'm a data modeler with over 8 years of experience across a range of industries including retail, oil and gas, power, food manufacturing, and consulting. I specialize in designing efficient, scalable data models that help businesses turn raw data into actionable insights.

I have a deep passion for building creative solutions using both code and hardware. Whether it’s automating workflows, visualizing complex systems, prototyping with microcontrollers, or tinkering with DIY electronics projects, I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of data and technology. 

Outside of work, I love spending time with my wife and two boys, especially outdoors. Whether we’re hiking, biking, or just exploring new parks, being in nature with my family is one of my favorite ways to recharge.
